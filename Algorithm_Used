The algorithm followed in this application is of string matching and various possible answers of same type are saved in HashMap and output is produced accordingly. 
When the input String is obtained, it is converted to LowerCase to prevent many possibilities like: “Where” can be just reduced to “where” and so on. 
Initially all eight possible outcomes are marked as “Any” and then accordingly the output of every value is changed on the basis if the possibilities are matched. 
Eventually all these things are merged into a StringBuilder (for faster processing). And for each input until EOF(end of File) the queries are executed and checked for all possibilities of output. 
Also, the final output is being saved in the external memory card by a filename “output.txt”.
